            <p class="boxDescription">Hello there! My name is Kiran Kunigiri. I've been a web and iOS developer for 2 years, and I make cool new projects everyday. I live in California in the Silicon Valley and I go to Cupertino High School. I'm a sophomore there, and although I'm busy with school, I always make sure I have time to code! I'm currently working on several projects, and am also open to any internships or other projects to work together on.
